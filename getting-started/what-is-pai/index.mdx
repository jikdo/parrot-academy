PAI is a decentralized stablecoin that is backed by overcollateral assets in the Parrot Protocol. Overcollateral assets ranges from stable LP tokens to assets like SOL.

## How to get PAI
You can get access to PAI by depositing collateral into a Parrot Vault and borrowing PAI. The amount of PAI you can borrow is based
on the collateral ratio of the vault. [You can read more about collateral ratio here](#) .

For example, you can borrow/mint PAI by depositing 100 SBR USDC into the USDC-PAI+EARN vault at a collateral ratio of 120% .

## Why you should mint PAI
PAI offers a way to multiply your collateral by repeating the deposit and mint process. Therefore, increasing your exposure to 
higher APYs. This is because Parrot uses assets deposited into +EARN vaults to farm yield which is airdropped to depositers weekly.

For example, with a 1000 USDC as initial collateral you can mint up to 833 PAI and swap to 833 USDC to deposit as collateral and have 1833 USDC as 
collateral which will expose you to more yield. You can repeat this process to get more exposure to higher yields till you can't mint anymore PAI.

## How PAI maintains it's peg against USD
PAI is overcollateralized and it uses a dynamic interest rate to protect underlying assets. This urges borrowers to pay debts (reduce PAI  supply) when PAI is below peg to avoid high interest rates.
And thus increase the value of PAI. Interest rate fees is paid to PAI [Stability pool](#) providers so it incentivize users to balance PAI liqudity pools to maintain peg.
