Collateral ratio on a vault determines how much you can borrow against your collateral and also determines at what point 
your collateral risks being liquidated. The formula for determing collateral ratio of a postion is 
 `Value of Collateral / Value of Debt * 100` represented as a percentage.

 Each asset accepted as collateral has it's own minimum collateral ratio. It is important to make sure the collateral ratio on your 
 collateral is always equal or above the minimum collateral ratio of the vault you borrowed from. Else you will get liquidated.

You can take these steps to avoid dropping below the collateral ratio;
* Repay some or all of your debt till you are in a safe zone.
* Deposit more collateral in the vault till you are safe zone.

For example, if you deposit 1000 USDC into the USDC+EARN vault, which has a collateral ratio of 120%. 
Let's say you borrow 400 USD, you collateral ratio will be `1000 USDC / 400 USDC * 100 = 250%`. Which puts you in safe area.
The amount you borrow determines the price at which you will get liquidated unless you add more collateral or repay your debt as 
discussed above.
