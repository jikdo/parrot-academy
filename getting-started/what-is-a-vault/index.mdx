A vault is a solana program that allows you to borrow assets against your collateral. It works by accepting deposits
of a required asset used as collateral so that you can borrow a particular asset for your needs. There are serveral vaults which supports
a wide range of assets as collateral on Parrot. 

Parrot currently allows you to borrow these assets from a vault;

1. Pai - An over-collateralized stable coin pegged to the USD
2. pSOL - An over-collateralized stable coin that uses aggregated staked sol tokens like prtSOL and mSOL. It is pegged to SOL 
3. pBTC - An over-collateralized stable coin pegged to BTC

Parrot has +EARN vaults that allows you to use leverage to increase your collateral by repeating the deposit and borrow process
with your borrowed capital. This exposes you to higher yields since assets deposited as collateral are used to farm yield and distributed to depositors.

You can only borrow assets up to a certain amount based on the collateral ratio of the vault. This helps debt to always be over-collateralized. And incase the 
deposited assets drops in value, a user may risk being liquidated. Unless they increase their collateral or pay their debt. [You can read more about Collateral Ratio here](/getting-started/understanding-collateral-ratio/)
